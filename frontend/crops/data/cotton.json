    "description": "Cotton is grown for the cotton boll, or protective case of soft, fluffy fibers around it's seeds. The boll is harvested, spun, and used to make textiles. Cotton is a member of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. There are four main cultivars of cotton. Gossypium hirsutum, or upland cotton, accounts for 90% of world production. While white cotton is the most common type, different varieties produce cotton bolls in a range of colors from green to brown to red, eliminating the need for dye. \n\nCotton plants have large flowers that resemble hibiscus. After the flowers fade, the boll grows around the seeds. The boll is designed to aid in seed dispersal. The cotton plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical areas around the world, including the Americas, Africa, and India. It requires a long, sunny growing season with moderate rainfall. The plants need 65-75 days above 15C to flower, and another 50 days for the seed pods to mature and open. Growers outside of this climate should start seeds indoors and transplant outside. Cotton is ready to be picked when the bolls crack open and the fluffy white cotton is exposed. Wear gloves - cotton bolls are sharp. Lay out to dry, then separate seeds from cotton.",
